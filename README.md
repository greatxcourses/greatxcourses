This script assumes that you have a CSV file called product_data.csv that contains the product data, including the name, description, image URL, price, and affiliate link. It also assumes that you have a Jinja2 template called landing_page_template.html that you want to use for creating the landing pages.

The script uses the Jinja2 template to render each landing page's HTML code, using the data from the CSV file as input. It then saves the HTML code to a file with a filename that includes the product name. The script also downloads the product image and saves it to a file with a filename that includes the product name.

This is just a basic example, and there are many ways you could customize this script to suit your specific needs and preferences. For example, you could add error handling, use a different templating engine, or add additional functionality to automate other parts of the affiliate marketing process.
